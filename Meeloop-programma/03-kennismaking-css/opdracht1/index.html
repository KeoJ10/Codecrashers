		<h1>Donkey Kong Country 3</h1>
		<p>Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble! is a 1996 platform video game developed by Rare and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It was released in November 1996 in North America and Japan, and on 13 December in Europe and Australia. It is the third installment of the Donkey Kong Country series and serves as a direct sequel to Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest.</p>
		<p>The plot centers around Dixie Kong and her cousin, Kiddy Kong, in their attempts to save the captured Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong from the series' antagonist King K. Rool. The game is set in the "Northern Kremisphere", a fictionalized version of northern Europe and Canada. Dixie Kong's Double Trouble! utilises the same Silicon Graphics technology from its predecessors, which features the use of pre-rendered 3D imagery. The game received positive reviews upon release; critics praised the visuals and various aspects of gameplay, but most were divided over the game's soundtrack.</p>
