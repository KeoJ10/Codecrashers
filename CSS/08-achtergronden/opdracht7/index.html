            <h1>Introduction</h1>Welcome to the Football Manager Introduction. This is designed to help familiarise you with the key areas of the game, to make you feel more comfortable as you get to grips with each module, and to hopefully be informative
            and educational. There are questions posed throughout that are answered to hopefully address any issues you might encounter or any queries you might have in your quest for... Quick Start Guide Having installed and launched Football Manager,
            youll understandably want to get stuck right into a new game. The very first thing you need to do, however, is create your Manager Profile. This will then be saved, so every time you launch the game after the initial setup, you wont need to
            repeat the process (unless you want to add more Manager Profiles). Creating a Manager Profile The very first...
            <h1>Staff</h1> The Staff Responsibilities menu allows you to specify which members of your backroom staff are designated to carry out specific roles to do with the day-to-day running of your club. They can help take significant weight off your
            shoulders and allow you to get on with enjoying the things you love most about being a football manager. TheResponsibilities screen displays everything youre currently...
            <h1>Tactics</h1> Tactical Templates To assist you in setting up a tactic, a number of templates are provided for you to use as a foundation for the way you want to play. Each tactical template sets a series of team and player instructions geared
            towards a particular style of play; once youve picked the one that best suits your plans (the textual descriptions on screen will help guide your choice), have a look at the following image...

            <h1>Tactics</h1> Tactical Templates To assist you in setting up a tactic, a number of templates are provided for you to use as a foundation for the way you want to play. Each tactical template sets a series of team and player instructions geared
            towards a particular style of play; once youve picked the one that best suits your plans (the textual descriptions on screen will help guide your choice), have a look at the various instructions set as a result to better understand whats going
            on.
            <h1>Mentalities</h1> What are the differences between mentalities and what do they change behind the scenes? Like many other mechanics in the game, mentalities can be thought of as being scored between 1-20. A Very Attacking mentality moves the
            score closer to 20 and represents the fact that the team is being asked to operate in a more attacking manner. Conversely, a Very Defensive mentality moves the scale much closer to the other end. Each base Mentality adjusts several tactical
            settings under the hood, combined with your tactical instructions, including intensity of press, line of engagement, tempo, attacking width, directness and time-wasting. In turn, mentalities also affect the actions of players set to an Automatic
            duty; a more attacking team mentality asks those players to be more attacking, and they are more defensive if you adopt a more defensive approach.
            <h1>Team Fluidity</h1> The number of attack, defend and support duties you set within a Formation while using a certain Mentality is reflected in your Team Fluidity. For example, a Balanced Mentality and a Balanced Fluidity has three players with
            Defend duties, four players with Support Duties, and three players with Attack duties. Your distribution of duties determines whether you move up or down the scale to more attacking or defensive football, and whether you apply more fluid or
            more rigid approaches. If you set seven players to have Attack Duties and three players with Defend duties, youll be playing with a Very Attacking mentality but a Very Rigid fluidity, as you havent provided sufficient balance within your overly
            attacking setup. Balancing this with more Support duties will achieve a more fluid result, and the same rule applies across the board, so feel free to play around with your options and see what happens there is no single correct solution.
            Your overall Fluidity is always indicated to you on the Tactics Overview screen.
            <h1>Formations</h1> <br><strong>What are they?</strong><br><br> A formation is the distribution of players across the pitch both in and out of possession. Football has developed to a point where teams play either three, four or five defenders,
            and then split the remainder of their outfield players between midfield duties (playing in the middle of the pitch) and the attack; players who are primarily there to score goals. A host of pre-set formations are ready for selection via the
            dropdown menu with the tactic name on; the Set to Formation option then lists a handful of the most prominent formations while also including sections covering all 3, 4, and 5 Defender formations. A 4 Defender formation has two central defenders
            and two full-backs; 3 and 5 Defender formations are often quite similar with the most significant difference being that the full-backs in 5 Defender formations become more advanced in 3 Defender formations and can often be found as part of
            the midfield instead. Most teams line up symmetrically to provide balance and options to move in either direction without becoming unpredictable, but again, this is not a hard and fast rule.</p>

            <h1>Roles and Duties</h1> Each role carries a text description alongside it that explains the fundamentals of what theyre being asked to do. You can see this by bringing up the position and role selection dialog. An additional sentence is appended
            to reference what happens when the players duty changes. A player can have an Attack, a Defend, or a Support duty, ostensibly adjusting how attacking theyre allowed to be within the teams overall mentality. They directly modify the player
            instructions to allow for a greater level of risk within the tactic, and those instructions in turn require slightly different attributes. Highlight Key Attributes for Role on the Player Profile screen identifies the different attributes needed
            to be effective in the role. How much does it matter if I play a player in an unfamiliar role? As outlined in the similar question about playing a player out of position, there are several degrees of severity as to how much it might matter.
            As a rule, it isnt quite as disadvantageous to play a player in an unfamiliar role as it would be for a different position, as the player is likely to at least still be in the same position on the pitch. The difference between a Box-to-Box
            Midfielder and an Attacking Playmaker isnt as marked as the difference between a Central Defender and a Central Midfielder, for example. To use a metaphor, theyre speaking different dialects of the same language, rather than a different language
            altogether. That said, you end up with diminishing returns if you ask a player to adopt a role to which their attributes are not suited. Asking a Ball Winning Midfielder to operate as a Trequartista is unlikely to yield positive results as
            they wont have the right attribute profile to perform the instructions set for that role. By using the Highlight Key Attributes for Role option on the player profile screen, you can see how much scope you have for asking a player to play an
            unfamiliar role, and that in turn gives you some insight into how they might perform on the pitch. Will playing in an unfamiliar role help learn that role faster? In short, yes. The more they play there, the more the attributes adjust to the
            requirements of the role, and as they should be training in the same role too, they become exposed to it on a daily basis. To be perfectly clear however, there is no set timeline for how long it can take for a player to learn. Instead, it
            depends on familiarity with the position, the quality of the coaching staff, the similarity of the positions and roles to those they can already play (a centre-back could learn to play full-back roles quicker than a striker role, for example),
            and what position and role theyre set to play in training. The more of those criteria that are matched successfully, the better chance they stand of learning it in a quicker period.
            <h1>Team Instructions</h1> Team Instructions effectively adjust the way your team plays. They operate on a sliding scale between attempting something much more frequently to much less often.
            <br><br><strong>in possession </strong><br><strong>Attacking Width:</strong><br> This controls how wide you move the ball when in possession. A wider approach stretches the field horizontally; a narrower one funnels play through the middle
            of the pitch. <br><br><strong>Approach Play:</strong><br> This instructs your players where to focus their passing. Pass Into Space asks players to lead their teammates into open spaces with their passing, rather than delivering it to their
            feet, in an effort to stretch the play and increase the overall tempo. They can Play Out Of Defence as well as focus their play down either flank or through the middle, and you should set this based on the strengths of your players and the
            weaknesses of the opposition. <br><br><strong>Passing Directness</strong><br> The Passing instructions above set the intention of the pass, the Directness instruction sets how it gets there. A more direct approach sees the ball played forward
            in a more vertical manner, with increased urgency, moving it from back to front as quickly as possible. Conversely, a shorter approach sees the ball moved patiently from side to side, probing for a way to unlock the defence.
            <br><br><strong>Tempo</strong><br> A higher tempo asks players to make more decisions in a quicker fashion, designed to capitalise on situations as they present themselves, and to force lapses in concentration. <br><br><strong>Time Wasting</strong><br>            The higher the setting here, the more your players look to do nothing with the ball and take more time over set pieces and dead balls. Final Third When you have the ball in the attacking third of the pitch, there are a host of options for
            you to ask your players to focus their play on. The focus is on how the ball makes its way into shooting positions. Mixed Crosses is set by default (except for Tiki-Tika, which uses Low Crosses) but you can change this to focus on high, low,
            or near post deliveries if it suits your players and/or the circumstances. Play For Set Pieces encourages every player to attempt to win corners, free kicks and throw-ins so as to allow the team to bring players forward for dead ball situations,
            attempting to command control of the match in that way. <br><br><strong>Dribbling</strong><br> Dribble Less makes the players more likely to pass the ball, while Run At Defence increases each players likelihood of dribbling with it. Creative
            Freedom Creative Freedom is closely tied to your overall Team Fluidity. Be More Expressive increases the overall fluidity score, while Be More Disciplined reduces it.
